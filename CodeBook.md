It is extracted and following files are used to create the data for analysis:

  ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt 
  
  ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/x_test.txt 
  
  ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt 
  
  ./UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt 
  
  ./UCI HAR Dataset/train/x_train.txt 
  
  ./UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt 
  
  ./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt 
  
  ./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt

Test and traings data are found in x_test and x_train files. 

features.txt file contains column names. The colum names used for the final data set are

The the detailed description of this data can be found in the features.info file. Basically these are 3d readings from the devises measuring activity.

Activities are categorised in 6 categories:

1 WALKING

2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4 SITTING

5 STANDING

6 LAYING


Subject numbers (persons using the devises are given only as numbers) in the subject_* files.

run_analysis.R program uses content of y_train.txt and y_test.txt and features.txt to create colum names. The file activity_lables.txt contains names of activities. The program replaces activity indexes with their names. Also it merges subject numbers with the data. Then it selects only data with mean() and std() values. Up to this point assignment steps 1-4 are completed. Finally data is aggregated by their mean value grouped by subject and activity and the result is writteninto the file CourseProjectFinalData.txt and result is also returned to the caller.
